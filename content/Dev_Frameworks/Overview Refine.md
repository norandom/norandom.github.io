## What is Refine?â€‹

**Refine** is a React meta-framework for CRUD-heavy web applications. It addresses a wide range of enterprise use cases including internal tools, admin panels, dashboards and B2B apps.

Refine's core hooks and components streamline the development process by offering industry-standard solutions for crucial aspects of a project, including **authentication**, **access control**, **routing**, **networking**, **state management**, and **i18n**.

Refine's headless architecture enables the building of highly customizable applications by decoupling business logic from UI and routing. This allows integration with:

- Any custom designs or UI frameworks like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), along with built-in support for [Ant Design](https://ant.design/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/), [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/), and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).
- Various platforms, including Next.js, Remix, React Native, Electron, etc., by a simple routing interface without the need for additional setup steps.
