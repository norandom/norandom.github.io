This presentation covers a static analysis tool Semgrep and how it can be leveraged to find different vulnerabilities in a variety of languages. We initially presented “Automated Bug Hunting with Semgrep” at a local event in San Diego. Due to the positive feedback, a video and similar presentation slides were created to help educate a larger audience of software developers and security professionals on the benefits of Semgrep and its automated source code analysis features. Enjoy!
